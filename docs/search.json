    "text": "CASA0023 Jin’s Learning Diary\nWelcome to my learning diary space which records learnings, reflections and musings from the teaching at CASA0023 Remote Sensing Cities and Environment as part of my studies at UCL’s MSc Urban Spatial Science.\nPrior to my studies at UCL, I was enrolled at the Bartlett School of Planning BSc Urban Planning, Design and Management programme. Hence, my background lies in more ‘humanities’ aligned topics like urban design, policy and sustainable development.\nIf we go even further back, I do have some background in more technical fields such as GIS and remote sensing. I served as a geospatial analyst in the Singapore Armed Forces during my 2-year military conscription prior to my undergraduate studies where I was taught softwares like ArcGIS. I later interned at the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and used Landsat-8/MODIS data to study Urban Heat Island effect in Singapore towns.\nMy interest in the built environment thus extends to the concept of liveability - how do we measure such a subjective term which can incorporate both technical (e.g temperature, shade, amenities) and design aspects (sense of safety, perceptions and emotions from facades).\nAcknowledgements:\nThis site is built using Quarto.",

    "text": "2 Introduction\nThe first week of Remote Sensing covers the definitions of remote sensing, what we can do with remote sensing and the technology behind it. The basic understanding of remote sensing is a definition by NASA: “acquiring information from a distance” which is quite broad. This means that even taking a photograph using mobile phones is considered remote sensing. However, the course is centred around satellite images and data, which covers a much larger area in specific areas of the earth and there are a wide range of tools, methods and data sources to choose from when analysing satellite data.\nFor example, there are many different sources of open satellite data that is available for analysis such as MODIS from NASA, Landsat-8 from USGS, and Sentinel-2 from the European Space Agency. They all capture data at different resolutions and capture different data types based on their sensor technologies.",

    "text": "2.1 Sensors\nTwo broad categories of sensors are active sensors and passive sensors. Passive sensors rely on reflect energy from the sun and thus needs to operate in the day, while active sensors can emit electromagnetic waves, and hence can be operated in the night, giving unique products like Nighttime satellite imagery. Synthetic Aperture Radar, a type of passive sensor, is also known for its all-weather penetration ability and thus is suitable for continuous monitoring. A lot of post-processing of the data also occurs behind the instruments; satellite data download typically has atmospheric corrections applied to it (e.g Landsat Level 2 surface reflectance rather than TOA) so that the data quality is enhanced and suited for scientific analysis.\nThe practical covers the comparison between two sources of satellite data – Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8. They contain different products which determines the different resolutions in terms of spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric.\nThe city of choice used in this practical is Kanagawa, Japan. It sits south of the Tokyo metropolitan ward, and has a diverse landuse cover ranging from heavy industries near the sea, to residential and the mountainous region to the west. The different band combinations of the satellite data can be used for various analytical functions, such as to identify a specific land use or soil health for example.\n\n False colour composite of Kanagawa which helps identifying greenery, soil and water bodies. Image produced with data from Landsat-8, processed in SNAP.\n\nAnother key concept is spectral signatures. Since different objects on the ground reflect electromagnetic waves differently across different wavelengths, we can capture the reflectance and associate it with a particular land use. Green vegetation absorbs red wavelengths but reflect NIR waves for example.\n Spectral bands of various land use covers. Image produced with data from Landsat-8, processed in RStudio.\nThe graph above is obtained from identifying (visually) various land use cover by drawing boundaries around them, and extracting the range of spectral signatures across the 6 bands. But this is just 5 land cover types. I presume the accuracy and box plot for each band will be smaller with more data put into identifying land uses since I did a pretty quick identification visually.",

    "text": "2.2 Applications\nA systematic review of remote sensing literature using Landsat-8 data was published by Hemati et al. (2021) which covers the trends, opportunities and future of using Landsat-8 data for various studies. The key takeaway is that the single most important feature of remote sensing is land use change, which 60% are attributed to human activities like industrialisation and urbanisation. Monitoring land use changes can yield important insights into how these processes are unfolding. The advancement of cloud computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine makes analysing satellite data over large areas across time possible and much easier than ever before. This was seen in how the number of images used per articles skyrocketed since 2000s with increased computation power. The most common land use change detection carried out is deforestation and urban expansion, and many data sources are often fused to improve data resolution of various products. Hemati et. al (2021) reports that Sentinel-2 and MODIS data are often fused with Landsat-8, thereby reaping benefits of different data sources – Sentinel for better spatial resolution and Landsat-8 for historical continuity for example.\nAn example of this is an algorithm developed by Gao et. al (2006) which fuses MODIS and Landsat-8 data to overcome limitations which previously hindered researchers from studying temporal patterns of plant and farming cycle/patterns. Of course, these applications are just merely scratching the surface of what remote sensing data can achieve. However, the worsening climate change and associated extreme climate events mean that remote sensing is becoming more important than ever before which can help understand and provide potential solutions and management tools.\n\n\n\nAs of the time of writing, the 2025 LA wildfires continues to blaze on after more than two weeks. Remote sensing is a useful tool to monitor the spread of the disaster and alert civilians to evacuate. Source: New York Times",

    "section": "2.3 Reflections",
    "text": "2.3 Reflections\nI previously worked used satellite data during my internship in the Housing Development Board in Singapore just before entering university. There are some quite real implications for policies and uses of satellite data in Singapore just because it built so densely. I was tasked with building a model to predict Land Surface Temperature, using factors such as land use classes, sky-view factors and impervious surface area. Machine learning algorithms was employed to predict land use classification in Singapore, using a smaller town as a training site.\nDue to the sheer density of the built environment in Singapore coupled with climate change, thermal comfort becomes a large problem living in Singapore and urban planners are looking into using satellite data to help inform the factors which affect land surface temperatures. With the model, planners can better understand the land use mix, configurations of tall buildings, and other elements which affects the built environment layout that can minimise heat retention in urban settings.\nAlthough I worked with these remote sensing data before, I did not know the technical index of the different datasets and even the sensors of the satellites. I am glad that learning remote sensing again ‘from scratch’ enable me to really examine how the data is captured and processed in depth, and appreciate the calibrations and issues with mapping the Earth.\nAnother interesting project I heard was identifying rooftops that are suitable for solar panel installations using satellite imaging. Similarly, this has policy implications such as climate change agreements, or the net zero policies in place. Instead of exhausting manpower to check rooftops, satellite imaging, with an algorithm, can identify rooftops with sufficient areas for solar panel retrofitting.\nThese are just two projects that utilises land use classes of satellite data to help inform real world problems and policy implementations.",

The flaws and artifacts in the data can come from the technical properties of the sensor, to atmospheric conditions while capturing data across earth. Each flaw is a huge can of worms, with extensive research and modelling happening in the background to ensure that the data that we download publicly is fit to use without distortions or influences from weather, sensor flaws or orthographic projection errors.\nIn simple terms, the pre-processing types can be arranged into four seperate categories:\nI also created a small dictionary for key terms learnt this week for quick referencing and look up of definitions.",

    "section": "5.1 Motivation?",
    "text": "5.1 Motivation?\nThis week I challenged myself to reading a few more technical papers discussing more about Land Cover and Land-Use (LCLU) applications of remote sensing, with the focus on methodologies used to classify them from Grey-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) to machine learning methods such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) in Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA). While it took a long time to understand what the papers were discussing or proposing, I felt that with the help of this week’s content and some googling, I could make sense of what the authors are investigating.\nThe first paper by Mryka Hall-Beyer (2017) is a particular introductory paper on GLCM - she first gives an overview of what GLCM is, its background on textures and the problems with using GLCM. One key issue with Principle Component Analysis used in GLCM is how it is dependent on the researcher choosing which measures and window size to use; and interpret PCA to decide which component to use for land-use classification. Hall-Beyer wishes to address this issue by developing a guideline for choosing relevant GLCM texture measures across different neighbourhood sizes and land covers. She produces different combinations of textures and window sizes on different land covers, and extract similar patterns seen in these combinations. The author found that even across very different land covers, GLCM Mean texture measure should be used as a first choice for classification, with GLCM Cor being used as an addition if necessary. GLCM Con should be used to characterise edge-like features and GLCM Ent can be added for more detailed studies. However, the author cautioned that these are just general guidelines for choosing GLCM textures and every image is different based on features that one might want to characterize. For example, Murray et al. (2010) found that the use of Mean, Con and Ent generated the most accurate land-use maps specifically for tundra vegetation. The author also raised an important point to always report textures and combination used along with its accuracies rather than just reporting the most successful model. This can help identify evidence-drive patterns and build a library of ‘textures combinations’ which is helpful for all researchers.\nThe second paper explores the use of GLCM textures in vegetation identification. Mohammadpour et al. (2022) developed a methodology integrating 4 vegetation indices and 12 texture variables into Sentinel 2A spectral bands to classify various vegetation species in complex land classification, with applications in wildfire risk management and biomass monitoring.\n\n\n\nProcess of vegetation mapping with Sentinel 2. Image taken from Mohammadpour et al. (2022)\n\n\nI think this process really aptly summarises the content I learnt this week - first we have reprojection/resampling, which is part of geometric corrections and image enhancement. Clipping region of interest is the same process of this week’s practical, for example using terra::crop and terra::mask. The authors used 4 vegetation indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), which are various band ratios covered in this week’s lectures as well. Texture extraction using GLCM was seen in the practical, although the paper covered the process in more details; including explaining the choice of texture metrics to bring forward to the Random Forest (RF). The model achieved a high Overall Accuracy of 90.9% and texture metrics seem to have increased the classification accuracy.",

    "text": "5.2 Reflections\nThis week’s content is pretty daunting at first glance, as we covered a lot of technical content behind how pre-processing works (and the math involved!), even though we probably do not need to handle much of the pre-processing ourselves. However, I do agree with Andy that it is still important for us to understand the calibrations and corrections that are occurring behind the scenes so that we understand where our data came from.\nThe second part of the lecture is very very interesting as image enhancement is a constantly evolving field, with different researchers developing new techniques or combining old ones to map out features that they would like to investigate. While reading the papers that utilises image enhancement and correction techniques, I learnt a lot more on the intricacies and problems behind mapping each feature, for example issues with mapping vegetation and their individual species. I realised that there is no one size fit all solution to image classification/enhancement; it depends on our own study area, climate and subject that we want to capture/map. All these tools and techniques are available to us but choosing the most appropriate ones and justifying these choices are the most important and crucial part of the research.",
