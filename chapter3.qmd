## Pre-processing

This week's content is slightly more technical, covering the different flaws in remote-sensing data and the different ways we can account and correct for them. The flaws and artifacts in the data can come from the technical properties of the sensor, to atmospheric conditions while capturing data across earth. Each flaw is a huge can of worms, with extensive research and modelling happening in the background to ensure that the data that we download publicly is fit to use without distortions or influences from weather, sensor flaws or orthographic projection errors.

In simple terms, the pre-processing types can be arranged into four seperate categories:

| Geometric Correction                                           | Image distortion introduced from view angle, topography, wind conditions and rotation of the earth. Using data collected from the sensor such as exact orbit, altitude, imaging parameters, and ground control points, images are resampled so that locations and accurate pixel values can be calculated. | ![](images/resampling.png)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Orthorectification Correction (subset of geometric correction) | Distortions caused by sensor tilt and topographical relief. Orthorectification ensures that each point appear as if each pixel is captured directly below the sensor.                                                                                                                                      | An example orthorectification correction is cosine correction which accounts for the angle at which sunlight hits the earth, causing variability in brightness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Radiometric Correction                                         | Spectral information captured by satellites are affected by atmospheric scattering, absorption which require correction, turning DNs to spectral radiance values.                                                                                                                                          | The [data handbook for Landsat-8](https://d9-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/atoms/files/LSDS-1574_L8_Data_Users_Handbook-v5.0.pdf) outlines several radiometric corrections based on the sensor property in order to correct for inconsistency for specific spectral bands. These include the OLI solar diffuser, lunar irradiance and underfly acquisitions among many others. |

## Applications

This week I challenged myself to reading a few more technical papers discussing more about Land Cover and Land-Use (LCLU) applications of remote sensing, with the focus on methodologies used to classify them from Grey-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) to machine learning methods such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) in Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA). While it took a long time to understand what the papers were discussing or proposing, I felt that with the help of this week's content and some googling, I could make sense of what the authors are investigating.

The Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is a widely used method for texture analysis, offering valuable insights into land cover classification by capturing spatial relationships between pixel intensities. However, one of the key challenges with GLCM is determining which texture measures and window sizes to use, as these choices can significantly impact the results. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is often employed to reduce dimensionality and select relevant components, but it requires subjective decisions by the researcher, which can introduce variability in interpretation and outcomes.

To address these challenges, [Hall-Beyer (2017)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01431161.2016.1278314?casa_token=G7qF5Jn6Xn4AAAAA:gmq40LcYmAbqabaPiQp3qTu7fZ9Zw3QDxe19yd6g5F4YKn2uUOMTroncVMPJEL6RIUGHn6rOn7-N5Q) explored guidelines for selecting relevant GLCM texture measures across different land covers and window sizes. Her findings suggest that certain texture measures tend to be more effective for classification across diverse land covers. For instance, GLCM Mean is generally a reliable first choice for classification, with GLCM Correlation (Cor) as a useful addition if needed. GLCM Contrast (Con) is particularly effective for identifying edge-like features, while GLCM Entropy (Ent) can enhance classification in more detailed studies.

However, these recommendations are not absolute, as texture measures should be chosen based on the specific characteristics of the image and the features being analyzed. For example, [Murray et al. (2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243410000097?casa_token=TEblmSg5LcoAAAAA:lqzDWClzFvFlrJ4qyhbvhkLU4xiNp3eA9y8JxUk_XfDFm0v0ABR1SuikW2rppD10yJ12OjUohSc) demonstrated that a combination of Mean, Con, and Ent produced the most accurate land-use maps for tundra vegetation. Hall-Beyer (2017) also emphasized the importance of documenting the chosen texture combinations and their associated accuracies, which can contribute to building a more evidence-based understanding of optimal GLCM settings for different applications. This can help identify evidence-drive patterns and build a library of 'textures combinations' which is helpful for all researchers.

## Applications II

After understanding what GLCM does, I wonder how this fits into a remote sensing data pipeline and how would this be used in a research project? Reading [Mohammadpour et al. (2022)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/18/4585)'s paper on the use of vegetation indices and textures on vegetation species classification gave me a better understanding of this technique in a research, which is succinctly placed together in the diagram below.

I think this diagram really aptly summarises the content I learnt this week - first we have reprojection/resampling, which is part of geometric corrections and image enhancement. Clipping region of interest is the same process of this week's practical, for example using terra::crop and terra::mask. The authors used 4 vegetation indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), which are various band ratios covered in this week's lectures as well. Texture extraction using GLCM was seen in the practical, although the paper covered the process in more details; including explaining the choice of texture metrics to bring forward to the Random Forest (RF). The model achieved a high Overall Accuracy of 90.9% and texture metrics seem to have increased the classification accuracy.

Beyond the high accuracy rate of 90.9%, the paper highlights the importance of complex land classification especially in Portugal where the study is located due to risk of wildfires in the summer. Knowing the locations of different species cluster can help support wildfire management efforts and forest resource management plans.

## Reflections

This week's content is pretty daunting at first glance, as we covered a lot of technical content behind how pre-processing works (and the math involved!), even though we probably do not need to handle much of the pre-processing ourselves. However, I do agree with Andy that it is still important for us to understand the calibrations and corrections that are occurring behind the scenes so that we understand *where* our data came from.

The second part of the lecture is very interesting as image enhancement is a constantly evolving field, with different researchers developing new techniques or combining old ones to map out features that they would like to investigate. While reading the papers that utilises image enhancement and correction techniques, I learnt a lot more on the intricacies and problems behind mapping each feature, for example issues with mapping vegetation and their individual species. I realised that there is no one size fit all solution to image classification/enhancement; it depends on our own study area, climate and subject that we want to capture/map. All these tools and techniques are available to us but choosing the most appropriate ones and justifying these choices are the most important and crucial part of the research.
